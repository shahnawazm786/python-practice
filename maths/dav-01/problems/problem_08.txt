Problem Statement:

You are given a numpy array containing marks of students in a class. The student gets distinction or first-division on the basis of the below criteria.

marks >= 80 : Distinction

60 <= marks < 80 : First Division

Find the ratio of number of students who got distinction to the number of students who got first division.


Input Format: (NOTE: No need to take the input explicitly — the input-handling code is already in place.)

A numpy array

Output Format:

A float number.

Sample Input:

array([20, 35, 68, 82, 83, 70, 90])

Sample Output:

1.5

Sample Explanation:

Distinction marks are 82, 83 and 90. So, 3 distinctions. First division marks are 68, 70. So 2 first divisions. Ratio = 3/2 = 1.5.
