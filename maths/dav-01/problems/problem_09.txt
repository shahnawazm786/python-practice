Create a sequence of a given length from a given start point, where the difference between 2 consecutive elements of the expected sequence is also given as step.

Input Format:

One line of input will have 3 space-separated integers consisting of start, length of sequence and step between two continuous elements of the sequence.
Output Format:

A numpy array of integers
Sample Input:

5 10 3
Sample Output:

[5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32]
Sample explanation:

Start of the sequence = 5, length of the sequence = 10 and step = 3.

First point would be the start point only, second point = start + 1*step = 5 + 1*3 =8, ....... 10th point = start + (10-1)*step = 5 + 9*3 = 32


Note: You can use either .arange() or .linspace() to solve this question.
