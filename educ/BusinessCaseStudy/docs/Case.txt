Mindset

Evaluation will be kept lenient, so make sure you attempt this case study.
Read the question carefully and try to understand what exactly is being asked.
Brainstorm a little. If you’re getting an error, remember that Google is your best friend.
You can watch the lecture recordings or go through your lecture notes once again if you feel like you’re getting confused over some specific topics.
Discuss your problems with your peers. Make use of the Slack channel and WhatsApp group.
Only if you think that there’s a major issue, you can reach out to your Instructor via Slack or Email.
There is no right or wrong answer. We have to get used to dealing with uncertainty in business. This is exactly the skill we want to develop.
