As an educational institute, you need to keep a track of all the registered students.

Here you're given the registration IDs and the corresponding dates of a batch of students.

You need to return a DataFrame containing the columns as follows:

RID: Id of the student
RDate: Date of joining of the student
RMonth: Month of joining of the student
RYear: Year of joining of the student
RDay: Day of joining of the student
Input Format: (NOTE: No need to take the input explicitly — the input-handling code is already in place.)

Number of testcases.
For each testcase there will be two lines of input.
First-line contains the registration IDs of the students, and the following line contains the corresponding registration dates.
Output Format:

Just complete the function that returns a Pandas dataframe object containing the columns mentioned. 
Sample Input:

1
56 92 29 93 55 32 
2021-01-01 2021-02-12 2021-04-16 2021-01-22 2021-01-15 2021-02-26 
Sample Output:



Sample Explanation:

For 1 test case, here we are given two input lists.
First one consisting of the registration ids and the second one consists of the registration dates of the corresponding registration ids.
Here through the solve function, a dataframe is returned which consists of columns RID, RDate, RMonth, RYear, RDay.
