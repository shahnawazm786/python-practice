In the above-given dataframe, usernames are the display names of the learner's accounts shown on a video-conferencing app when taking classes.

The instructor clearly said to the learners that usernames must contain the real name (name) of the learners.

We tried to print the userid of the learners who haven't followed the instruction:

def check(name,username):
    return name.lower() in username
 
df[~(df.apply(lambda x:check(x['name'],x['username']), axis=0))]['userid']

Note: 'username' will be in lowercase.

We found that we are not getting the required results using the code, what can be the reason here?


Use the code below in order to create the given dataframe:

import pandas as pd

data = {
    'name': ['Jim', 'Clarke', 'Kent', 'Mark'],
    'username': ['itsjimhere', 'clark002', 'itskentment', 'markyoumustknow'],
    'userid': [20, 10, 86, 21]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
