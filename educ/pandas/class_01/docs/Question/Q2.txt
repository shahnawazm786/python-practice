Problem Description:

Given a dataframe containing transaction data sorted in order of transaction date, and row range r1 (start index) and r2 (end index).

Filter out the rows between r1 and r2 (r2 is exclusive).
Complete the function select_rows() to do the same, with dataframe and r1 and r2 values provided to the function.
Return only the "name" and "amt" columns from the filtered dataframe.
Input Format: (NOTE: No need to take the input explicitly — the input-handling code is already in place.)

First line of the input contains the dataframe.
Next two lines contain the value of r1 and r2 respectively.
Output Format:

The selected rows of dataframe as per r1 and r2.

Sample Input:



r1 = 1

r2 = 3

Sample Output:



Sample Explanation:

We selected only rows 1 and 2, excluding 3, in the original dataset.
