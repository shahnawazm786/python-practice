You're working on collecting the text data for a Natural Language Processing(NLP) project. You come up with the idea of storing the unique words (case-sensitive) with their frequency in a Pandas Series object.

You are given the raw data in form of a string, Write a function which can take a string as an input and return the unique words and the corresponding frequency in form of a Pandas Series object.

The indices of the series should be the unique words and the values should be the frequency of those unique words.

Note that:

String contains no special character.
Always a Non-empty string.
Case sensitive i.e. He and he should be treated as two different word tokens.
Series returned is expected to be sorted by sort_index()for sorting all the words.
Input Format
Number of testcases
String with space separated words. (basically a sentence)
Output Format
space separated words in first line.
space separated values in the second line.
Sample Input
1
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
