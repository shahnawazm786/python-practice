You are given two DataFrames:

movies with columns: movie id, title, year, director id
directors with columns: id, director_name
How would you correctly retrieve the names of all distinct directors who have directed movies since 2010 (inclusive)?

Movies: Link

Directors: Link

Options:

A.

sample = movies[movies["year"] >= 2010] 
ids = sample["directorid"].unique() 
names = directors[directors["id"].isin(ids)]["directorname"]
B.

sample = movies[movies["year"] >= 2010] 
ids = sample["directorid"] 
names = directors[directors["id"] == ids]["directorname"]
C.

sample = movies[movies["year"] > 2010] 
ids = sample["directorid"].unique() 
names = directors[directors["id"].isin(ids)]["directorname"]
D.

ids = movies["directorid"].unique() 
names = directors[directors["id"].isin(ids) & (movies["year"] >= 2010)]["directorname"]
