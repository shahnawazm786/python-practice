Problem Statement:

Given two 2D arrays, row and column ranges,

Perform the following operations:

Find the matrix multiplication of the given two matrices and
Extract the elements from the output of above step using the given ranges
If matrix multiplication is not possible, return -1
Note: The end points (upper range) of both rows and columns are excluded.

Input Format: (NOTE: No need to take the input explicitly — the input-handling code is already in place.)

There will be four lines of input as follows:  
First line will have mat1.  
Second line will have mat2.  
Third line will have two space-separated integers representing start and end point of rows.  
Fourth line will have two space-separated integers representing start and end point of columns.
Output Format:

A Numpy array
Sample Input:

[[6 6 4 7 9]  
 [0 2 2 9 3]  
 [6 0 2 5 2]  
 [2 4 3 5 5]]  
[[8 6 6 8 3]  
 [2 7 0 3 1]  
 [3 2 1 5 2]  
 [7 0 7 6 8]  
 [1 5 6 4 5]]  
1 3  
2 4
Sample Output:

[[83 82]  
 [85 96]]
Sample explanation:

The dimension of product is (5,5), and the elements for rows 1 to 3 and columns 2 to 4 are prd[1][2], prd[1][3], prd[2][2] and prd[2][3] i.e. 83, 82, 85 and 96.
