Problem statement:

Given an 1D array and an integer k that specifies the number of equal parts to split the array into,

Perform the following operations:

Split the array into k number of equal parts.
Return the list of split arrays.
Assumption: The array can be split into k equal parts

Note: Recall how to split an array into equal parts.

Input Format:

Line separated numpy array and split count 
Output Format:

List of numpy arrays
Sample Input:

arr = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8]
k = 3
Sample Output:

[array([0, 1, 2]), array([3, 4, 5]), array([6, 7, 8])]
