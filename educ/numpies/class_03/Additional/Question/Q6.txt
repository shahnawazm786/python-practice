Problem Statement:

Given a NumPy array of shape (n,m). Add padding of a layer of 0’s on all 4 boundaries of the matrix.

Input Format: (NOTE: No need to take the input explicitly — the input-handling code is already in place.)

First line will be consisting of two space-separated integers representing n and m.  
There will be n lines of input consisting of m space-separated integers representing the elements of rows of the array.
Output Format:

A 2d numpy array.
Sample Input:

3 2  
1 2  
3 4  
5 6
Sample Output:

[[0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 2 0]
 [0 3 4 0]
 [0 5 6 0]
 [0 0 0 0]]
