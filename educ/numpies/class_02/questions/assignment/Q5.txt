Given 3 arrays,

arr1 = np.array([1,2,3,6,3,2]) 
arr2 = np.array([4,2,1,3,3,2]) 
arr3 = np.zeros(len(arr1)) 
Which of the following are vectorized code(s) for array operations?

A.

for i in range(len(arr1)): 
    arr3[i] = arr1[i] * arr2[i] 

B.

arr3 = arr1*arr2 

C.

for i in range(len(arr1)): 
    if(arr1[i] < 0 ): 
        arr1[i] = -1 
    else: 
        arr1[i] = 1

D.

np.where(arr1 > 0, 1, -1)
