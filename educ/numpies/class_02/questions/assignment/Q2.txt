Problem Statement:

Given a 2d array, write a program to return a subarray such that the subarray consists of the elements from:

1. the second to the fourth row of the original array,

2. the elements in these rows should be from the last three columns of the corresponding rows of the original array,

3. the rows should be in reversed order.

Sample Input:

[[ 0,  1,  2,  3],  
 [ 4,  5,  6,  7],   
 [ 8,  9, 10, 11],   
 [12, 13, 14, 15],   
 [16, 17, 18, 19]]
Sample Output:

array([[13, 14, 15],  
       [ 9, 10, 11], 
       [ 5,  6,  7]])
Input Format: (NOTE : No need to take the input explicitly, the input-handling code is already in place.)

A 2D list
Output Format:

A 2D numpy array
Note:

This question can be solved using negative indexing and slicing
