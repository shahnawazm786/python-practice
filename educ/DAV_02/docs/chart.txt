Lecture Summary (Data Visualization - 1):

Introduction to Matplotlib & Seaborn
Learned the purpose of visualization (exploratory vs explanatory).

Understood the differences between Matplotlib (customizable, low-level) and Seaborn (built on top of Matplotlib, easier, aesthetically richer).

Covered essential components of a Matplotlib figure: Figure, Axes, Axis, labels, ticks, legends, and plot titles.

Univariate Visualization — Categorical Data

Bar Chart using plt.bar() and sns.countplot() to visualize category frequencies.

Improved readability using figure size, rotation, colors, labels, titles, and plt.show().

Pie Chart to compare proportions of categories (e.g., regional sales distribution).

Univariate Visualization — Numerical Data

Histogram for understanding distribution, skewness, and frequency of numerical data.

Learned bin customization, extracting counts and bin edges, and Seaborn’s histplot.

KDE Plot (sns.kdeplot) for smooth density estimation instead of histogram bars.

Boxplot for Distribution & Outliers

Used sns.boxplot to visualize median, quartiles, IQR, whiskers, and outliers.

Understood five-number summary and how boxplots highlight spread and extreme values.
